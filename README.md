Chat Direct
</h1>

Chat Direct was built to help me and my friends opening WhatsApp chats directly without saving phone numbers you want to chat with. and we find it pretty useful! 

It is currently only available in Arabic.

## Features
- Selecting country code from the dialogue
- The selected country code will be saved locally using `Hive`
- Filling country code field automaticaly sellects it if it's correct
- Pressing the final button "ابدأ المحادثة" will launch ```wa.me``` URL with the phone code + number
